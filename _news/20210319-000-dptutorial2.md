The [second part of my tutorial on differential privacy](https://www.borealisai.com/en/blog/tutorial-13-differential-privacy-ii-machine-learning-and-data-generation/) is now available.  The [first part](https://www.borealisai.com/en/blog/tutorial-12-differential-privacy-i-introduction/) was a basic introduction to DP, while part II focuses on using differential privacy in the context of machine learning.
