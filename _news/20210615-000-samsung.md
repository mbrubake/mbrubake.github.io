I am excited to announce that I have joined the [Toronto Samsung AI Center](https://research.samsung.com/aicenter_toronto) part time as a Visiting Professor.  I will be working there several hours a week overseeing exciting new projects in computer vision and machine learning with their excellent team of researchers.
