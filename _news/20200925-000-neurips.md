Two papers on normalizing flows have been accepted at [NeurIPS 2020](https://neurips.cc).  Congratulations and thanks to the students, Jason and Ruizhi, and my excellent collaborators!
 - _Wavelet Flow: Fast Training of High Resolution Normalizing Flows_ with Jason Yu and Konstantinos Derpanis (arxiv preprint to come)
 - [_Modeling Continuous Stochastic Processes with Dynamic Normalizing Flows_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10516) with Ruizhi Deng, Bo Chang, Greg Mori and Andreas Lehrmann
