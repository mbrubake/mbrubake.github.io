I recently co-authored a <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9089305">review article</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09257">(preprint version)</a> on Normalizing Flows which will be published in IEEE Transactions of Pattern Analysis and Machine Intellgience.  Normalizing Flows is a topic that I'm excited about and looking to work more on in the future.  If you've not seen it before, please check it out.
