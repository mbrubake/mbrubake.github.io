A major focus of my research over the last few years as been into new methods for the determination of 3D structures of viruses and proteins.
A big piece of that work has been published today in [Nature Methods](http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nmeth.4169.html).
This article describes the algorithmic advances which underpin [cryoSPARC](http://cryosparc.com).
This work was done in collaboration with Ali Punjani (PhD Student, University of Toronto), John Rubinstein (Senior Research Scientist, Hospital for Sick Children) and David Fleet (Professor, University of Toronto).  
For a non-technical introduction to our work, you can take a look at [this story](http://ose.utsc.utoronto.ca/ose/story.php?id=9194) out of University of Toronto, Scarborough.
