I'm an Assistant Professor of [Computer Science](https://www.eecs.yorku.ca/) at [York University](https://yorku.ca), a Faculty Affiliate at the [Vector Institute](http://vectorinstitute.ai) and an Adjunct Professor in the [University of Toronto Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.toronto.edu).  Previously I was a Researcher Director (2018-2020) at [Borealis AI](https://borealisai.com) where I continue to work as an Academic Advisor.  I studied at the University of Toronto where I received my PhD in 2011.  I also did postdocs at the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago, Toronto Rehabilitation Hospital and the University of Toronto.  My research interests span computer vision, machine learning and statistics.

I am a member of the [Centre for Vision Research](https://www.cvr.yorku.ca) and core member of the [Vision: Science to Application (VISTA)](https://vista.info.yorku.ca/) program.  I currently serve as an Associate Editor for [IET Computer Vision](http://digital-library.theiet.org/content/journals/iet-cvi) and have been an Area Chair for a number of conferences.
