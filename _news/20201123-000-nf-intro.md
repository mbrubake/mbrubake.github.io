This summer I presented a [tutorial at ECCV 2020 on normalizing flows](https://mbrubake.github.io/eccv2020-nf_in_cv-tutorial/) with Ullrich Koethe and Carsten Rother.  I've finally uploaded [my lecture which provides an introduction to normalizing flows](https://youtu.be/u3vVyFVU_lI).  Feedback is welcome!
