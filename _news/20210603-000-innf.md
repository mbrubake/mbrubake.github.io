Happy to annouce that I will be giving an invited talk at the [INNF+ Workshop](https://invertibleworkshop.github.io/) at ICML this year.  My collaborators and I also had two papers accepted for presentation at the workshop:
 - [_Manifold Density Estimation via Generalized Dequantization_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07143) by James A Brofos, Marcus A Brubaker and Roy R Lederman
 - _Agent Forecasting at Flexible Horizons using ODE Flows_ by Alexander Radovic, Jiawei He, Janahan Ramanan, Marcus A Brubaker and Andreas Lehrmann (paper to come)
Stay tuned for more information on my talk.
