I'm an Assistant Professor of [Computer Science](http://www.eecs.yorku.ca/) at [York University](http://yorku.ca), a Faculty Affiliate at the [Vector Institute](http://vectorinstitute.ai) and an Adjunct Professor in the [University of Toronto Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.toronto.edu).  Previously I was a Researcher Director (2018-2020) at [Borealis AI](http://borealisai.com) where I continue to work as an Academic Advisor.  I studied at the University of Toronto where I received my PhD in 2011.  I also did postdocs at the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago, Toronto Rehabilitation Hospital and the University of Toronto.  My research interests span computer vision, machine learning and statistics.

I am a member of the [Centre for Vision Research](http://www.cvr.yorku.ca) and core member of the [Vision: Science to Application (VISTA)](http://vista.info.yorku.ca/) program.  I currently serve as an Associate Editor for [IET Computer Vision](http://digital-library.theiet.org/content/journals/iet-cvi) and have been an Area Chair for a number of conferences.


## Research Interests
I am interested in building rich, detailed models of the world which capture fundamental relationships between the world and our observations of it. Such models ultimately enable us to measure and predict sometimes surprising details.

Most recently I have been focusing on probabilistic generative models, specifically normalizing flows.  My research has been exploring theoretical aspects of normalizing flows and their applications.  I also have an interest on the problem of estimating the 3D structure of biological molecules such as proteins and viruses with Cryo-EM.  Beyond those current focuses, I have also worked on vehicle localization for robotics, physically realistic models of human motion, probabilistic programming languages, Bayesian methods, MCMC and forensic ballistics.

## Prospective Students
Interested in joining my group?  I'm also on the look out for exception students and colleagues to work with.  More information on joining my group is available [here](/joining/).
