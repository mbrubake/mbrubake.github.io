Our new paper on dynamic textures is now available on arXiv <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06982">here</a> and the website with more results and details can be found <a href="https://ryersonvisionlab.github.io/two-stream-projpage/">here</a>.
Also, I'll be attending CVPR in July.  If you're going to be there and would like to meet up, feel free to drop me an email.
