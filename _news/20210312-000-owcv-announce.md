Proud to announce that I'm serving as the General Chair for the first ever [Ontario Workshop on Computer Vision](https://owcv2021.github.io).  This is a trainee focused event aiming to provide a forum for computer vision researchers in the province of Ontario to share their early work, network and establish new collaborations.  There will be several keynote sessions, poster sessions and more.  Keep an eye on the website and OWCV twitter accounts for more information.
