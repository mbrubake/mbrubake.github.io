Happy to announce that Ullrich Koethe and I will be again running our [tutorial on Normalizing Flows and Invertible Neural Networks in Computer Vision](https://mbrubake.github.io/cvpr2021-nf_in_cv-tutorial/) at CVPR 2021.  This will be an updated version of the tutorial we presented at [ECCV 2020](https://mbrubake.github.io/eccv2020-nf_in_cv-tutorial/).  The introductory video from that offering is [available here](https://youtu.be/u3vVyFVU_lI).  Feel like something should have been presented differently?  Want to see more about some other topics?  Let me know, feedback is welcome!
