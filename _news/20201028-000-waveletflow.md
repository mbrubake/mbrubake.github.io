The code and paper for our NeurIPS 2020 paper, _Wavelet Flow: Fast Training of High Resolution Normalizing Flows_, is now available.  The code is availble through the [Wavelet Flow GitHub Project](https://github.com/YorkUCVIL/Wavelet-Flow).  The paper can be found on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13821).  All of this, and additional image results, can be found on the [Wavelet Flow Project Page](https://yorkucvil.github.io/Wavelet-Flow/).
